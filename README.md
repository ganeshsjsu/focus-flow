## What is this?

Focus Flow is a free, "Brain.fm-like" web app that generates endless background music.
Instead of looping a YouTube video, it uses **Tone.js** to compose music in real-time.
It never repeats, never stops, and helps you stay in the zone.

## Features

- **Generative Audio Engine**: Infinite chord progressions and drum patterns.
- **Dynamic Variety**: Switches between different vibes (Deep C Minor, Groovy Dorian, Dreamy Lydian) and instruments (Rhodes, Glassy Bells, Retro Saw).
- **Control**: Adjust intensity/tempo or skip to a new vibe instantly.
- **Offline Capable**: Runs entirely in the browser (once loaded).

## Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ganeshsjsu/focus-flow.git
cd focus-flow
npm install
npm run dev
```

Built with React, Vite, and Tone.js.
